# Gann Pivot Levels

This code is a sample implementation of the Gann Pivot Levels indicator in MQL5. The Gann Pivot Levels are used in technical analysis to identify potential support and resistance levels in the market. The indicator calculates five pivot levels based on the previous high, low, and close prices. 

## How it works

The `CalculatePivotLevel` function is used to calculate the pivot levels based on the level parameter and the previous high, low, and close prices. The function uses a switch statement to determine the calculation formula for each level. The calculated pivot level is then returned.

The code also includes functions to support trading strategies, perform technical analysis, create a user-friendly interface, and optimize performance. The `IsScalpingStrategy` and `IsDayTradingStrategy` functions check if specific trading strategies are enabled. The `AnalyzeMarketTrends`, `IdentifyPatterns`, and `ProvideRealTimeData` functions implement code to analyze market trends, identify patterns, and provide real-time data, respectively. The `CreateUserInterface` function creates a user interface, and the `OptimizePerformance` function optimizes the performance of the program.

The entry point of the program is the `OnInit` function, where the pivot levels are calculated using the `CalculatePivotLevel` function. The code then checks if specific trading strategies are enabled and executes the corresponding code blocks. After that, it performs market analysis, pattern identification, real-time data provision, user interface creation, and performance optimization.

The code also includes event handlers such as `OnDeinit`, `OnTick`, `OnTrade`, and `OnTimer`, which can be used to handle program termination, tick events, trade events, and timer events, respectively.
